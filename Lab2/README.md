This assignment helps us understand the following:
• know how to build the structure and perform training of an RBF network
for either classication or regression purposes

• be able to comparatively analyse dierent methods for initialising the
structure and learning the weights in an RBF network

• know the concept of vector quantisation and learn how to use it in NN
context

• be able to recognise and implement dierent components in the SOM
algorithm

• be able to discuss the role of the neighbourhood and analyse its eect on
the self-organisation in SOMs

• know how SOM-networks can be used to fold high-dimensional spaces and
cluster data
